# Swot Anaylsis
## Strengths:  Cheap and affordable for Polish people
## High profit margins as lots of Polish food is cheap to make
## Unique experience as there are almost no Polish restaurants in Sioux South Dakota
## Customer Service is a priority
## Better food quality than most restaurants for it’s price


### Weaknesses: 
## In a remote part of the US
## Sioux doesn’t have neighboring cities for many miles so it’s limited to it’s customers in Sioux Falls
## If bad reputation gets built, it will go out of business instantly
## Low population so there might be a hard time getting employees
## A lot of people near Sioux are farmers and might not be interested in working for a resteraunt


### Opportunities:  
## Cost of meat and food is cheaper as they live in the Midwest
## Easy to build as South Dakota is still a growing state


### Threats: 
## Not enough people come because they’re just not interested in Polish foods
## Not enough Polish people live near Sioux so most people don’t have an interest
